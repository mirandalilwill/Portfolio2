                <h1>Research Paper for East Asian Politics Class</h1>
                <p>The Chinese state’s policy prescriptions for religious activity have been shaped by multiple
                    developments since the inception of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1949. Before and after the
                    Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), which saw the eradication of almost all religious activity in
                    China, the Chinese state conducted a slew of campaigns against particular religious groups, claiming
                    that they jeopardized social stability or too directly tested the supreme authority of the CCP.
                    Furthermore, drawing on a theme reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution, the fear of reverting to
                    backwards traditions that were thought to retard the modernization of China has motivated the
                    suppression of certain religious activities.
                    At present, religious freedom is not reliable in Chinese society. Nevertheless, as foreign,
                    democratic, liberalizing influences infiltrate China, the population agitates for more religious
                    autonomy. In many instances, this agitation manifests in underground movements, where adherents
                    attempt to circumvent the dictates of the CCP, and escape harassment or imprisonment for their
                    unapproved beliefs. Gaining approval to practice a certain religion means that it must fall into one
                    of five state-defined religious categories: Buddhism, Daoism, Protestantism, Catholicism, or Islam.
                    Yet even these categories do not always give religious activity legitimacy. Ultimately, their fate
                    is decided by the whims of the Party. Those that refuse to mold themselves into one narrowly defined
                    religion are not recognized by the state, and are therefore, technically illegal. Consequently, they
                    will face some form of persecution.
                    However, not all religious movements/activities are suppressed in China. A few, key characteristics
                    of some religious beliefs, like their efficacy, potential for economic stimulus, platform for
                    political propaganda, or their ability to afford the Chinese populace necessary social cohesion,
                    give them legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese state. Thus, there is a distinct dichotomy in the
                    relationships between the state and religious movements. Religious activity from which the CCP can
                    extract utility, likely concerning the above-mentioned characteristics, will be tolerated in China,
                    even encouraged to flourish. As the findings from this paper indicate, the opposite is true for
                    those movements from which the state fails to derive any significant utility, and those which exist
                    as a potential threat to CCP authority.
                    The main focus of my research, and the question I aim to explore in this paper is: to what to what
                    extent does the Chinese state’s treatment of different religious movements reflect the strength and
                    reach of political control in China?
                    Literature Review
                    The state’s approach to religious movements in China is multifaceted and complex. While rooting out
                    nearly all religion in China is thought to promote the “general good of society,” there are
                    certainly instances where religious activity is not only tolerated, but promoted (Georgiou). If a
                    religious movement can prove its efficacy to the state, whether this efficacy exists as a potential
                    economic growth stimulant, a vehicle for political propaganda, or a social glue, it may receive
                    Party support, so long as it maintains a safe distance from any authoritative role.
                    Conversely, unrecognized as well as recognized religious activity that attempts to subvert state
                    authority can expect to be sought out by agents of the Party and face severe punishment. Invoking
                    Article 36 of the Constitution, the “Four Cardinals” principals, or the official atheist position of
                    the party, state methods range from the demolition of temples and important religious buildings to
                    brutal imprisonment of religious dissidents. This thorough eradication of nearly all subversive
                    religious activity is motivated by an amalgamation of fears, mostly influenced by historical themes
                    and encroaching foreign influence. However, though members of the international community find
                    China’s egregious human rights abuses to be intolerable, the perspective of the CCP must be equally
                    considered. All religious clamp downs are not created equal. Some instances serve more specific and
                    complex purposes than simply eliminating authoritative competition.
                    A modernizing developmental trajectory has steered China through a multitude of campaigns designed
                    to stamp out any hint of backwards traditions or superstitious beliefs that might disrupt this
                    trajectory. In his article, “Old-time Religion in New China: Alternative Religious Movements in the
                    Post-Mao Era,” Jonathan Walton of UC San Diego explains that the idea of a “New China” developed in
                    the 1950s, and excluded any elements of society that might make the Chinese populace “backward,
                    uneducated, superstitious, [or] weak” (Walton). Superstition and religious folklore were associated
                    with poverty and the uneducated masses—the segment of the population that would prohibit the
                    development of a modern China. Therefore, a reform-and-control approach developed, where the state
                    attempted to transform the institution of religion to exist as an authoritative, ideological arm of
                    the Party, promoting “loyalty to the new nation-state” (Walton). Eventually, however, the Cultural
                    Revolution saw the total suppression of nearly all religious activity, instead of an attempt to
                    transform it.
                    Even today, fear of a ‘backwards’ reversion prompts an animosity toward religious influences. As
                    Eleanor Albert, writing for the Council of Foreign Relations, explains, the Party officially takes
                    an atheist position, and warns Party members against participating in any sort of religious
                    activity, referring to it as “spiritual anesthesia,” (Albert). Ideally, the CCP prefers that
                    “religion… wither away over time” (Georgiou). Though the irony is clear in that religious freedom is
                    an accepted tenet of a modern, developed state, a populace actively partaking in religious activity
                    reminds Party leadership of the China of the first half of the twentieth century, mired in
                    traditions antithetical to a modern state. Therefore, the merit of religious institutions cannot
                    outweigh what the CCP considers their potential for instability and disruption to China’s
                    developmental progress.
                    According to Georgiou, this developmental progress is defined as a “socialist path,” of which the
                    Chinese government fears “religion can interrupt” (Georgiou). In order to eventually reach a
                    communist utopia, ideological expression must be kept within the bounds carved out by Party
                    officials. Thus, in instances where the state cannot exact control over religious activity—otherwise
                    known as “unregistered” activity—there is fear that these groups may “disrupt public order, impair
                    the health of citizens, or interfere with the educational system of the state” (Albert). Whether
                    these disruptions manifest in public demonstrations or the encouragement of followers to subvert
                    state authority, and thus dilute ideological conformity, the CCP recognizes that this inherently
                    creates political instability. As Xi Jinping commits China to reach ambitious economic benchmarks in
                    the coming decades, the less that China has to address democratic agitation and political
                    disturbances, the more it can focus on achieving the developmental progress and economic growth
                    desired by Xi Jinping’s administration.
                    However, a contending perspective says that easing up on human rights should not impede
                    developmental progress. Peter Baehr, a Chair Professor of Social Theory at Lingnan University in
                    Hong Kong, claims that there is little to no historical evidence that “a restriction of civil and
                    political rights contributes to the economic development of a country” (Baehr et al). Nonetheless,
                    that a relaxation of political rights and a reformed political system have the potential to create
                    political instability means that by their very nature, they have equal potential to disrupt China’s
                    developmental track.
                    In the same vein, religious activity that can’t be monitored, manipulated, and even controlled poses
                    a significant challenge to Party authority, especially considering that the threat can’t be
                    accurately quantified. The government’s estimates of religious adherents in China fall just shy of
                    10 percent of the total population, yet Freedom House, an advocacy group, proposes a far larger
                    number—nearly 30 percent of the population, or 350 million. The U.S. State Department offers an even
                    higher estimate of 650 million—a colossal 50 percent of the population (Albert). Regardless of which
                    estimate is most accurate, the threat is magnified simply by the fact that the CCP cannot assess the
                    magnitude of unregistered Chinese religious movements, nor, without adequate data, can it fully
                    understand their motivations. Although the CCP recognizes religious membership as having potential
                    for a reversal of China’s modernizing, developing trend, Albert suggests that heightened religious
                    regulation in China has “less to do with religious doctrine that with a group’s organizational
                    ability.” Institutions that do not fall under the umbrella of the Party’s ideological control,
                    engender loyalty among the Chinese populace, and espouse unapproved beliefs and alternative messages
                    evidently threaten the strength of the Party’s supremacy. As religion continues to expand beyond
                    private, personal experiences, the party is “[unwilling] to see religion expressed as a sort of
                    collective authority” (Albert).
                    However, other perspectives assert that this threat is largely overstated. André Laliberté, a
                    political science professor at the University of Ottawa, describes China’s religious community as a
                    “fragmented…landscape” that likely lacks the revolutionary spirit and organizational talent to
                    “mount a credible political challenge to the regime” (Laliberté).
                    Another area of concern lies in whether heightened religious autonomy opens the door to encroaching
                    foreign influence. There are two main tenets that constitute this fear. First, a desire to maintain
                    a “cultural relativism” that promotes “Asian values” discourages foreign influences that might
                    dilute this cultural purity. Jacques Delisle, a former law professor at the University of
                    Pennsylvania, associates “Asian values” with a desire to promote a certain “Chineseness,” which is
                    intended to inspire “group interests and cohesion” among members of Chinese society (Delisle).
                    Foreign influences may be incompatible with this approach, and thus disruptive to a key element in
                    the Chinese “developmentalist” model. Second, the CCP believes that China’s governance of its
                    religious institutions is an entirely sovereign affair that does not require the input of the
                    international community. Article 36 of the Chinese Constitution affirms that religion is reserved to
                    the domestic domain, stating “religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign
                    domination” (China’s Constitution, Art. 36). This is a clear indication that the international
                    community, whether or not it finds China’s approach to religion to be a human rights violation, is
                    barred from any “controlling role” in such affairs (Britsch).
                    The complexity of the CCP’s system of religious fears is matched by the methods used in suppressing
                    religious movements. First and foremost, Party justification for strict religious regulation is
                    backed by the most important legal framework of the country, the Chinese Constitution. While Article
                    36 affirms China’s commitment to the promotion and protection of religious freedom, it
                    simultaneously allows room for a very ambiguous interpretation of this commitment. The governing
                    body will not, according to Art. 36, “discriminate against citizens who believe in… any religion,”
                    yet, they will also refrain from extending this protection to religious movements existing outside
                    of what is defined as “normal religious activities” (China’s Constitution, Art. 36). Elaborating on
                    this apparent contradiction, Zhaohui Hong argues that “normal is [much more] vague than ‘legal’”
                    (Hong). The legality of a religious activity or movement can be determined by its commitment to
                    keeping within the boundaries defined for religious activity in the Chinese Constitution. Normality,
                    on the other hand, is not expanded on, and therefore, through its ambiguity, increases the political
                    control that the Chinese government can exert on religious movements. Additionally, to single out
                    religion, particularly in reference to activities that may “disrupt public order, impair the health
                    of citizens, or interfere with the educational system of the state,” without also identifying
                    non-religious activities that have the same potential for these consequences, is to be
                    “[deliberately ambiguous]” and is an “expression of political discrimination” in itself (Hong).
                    The theoretical framework through which the CCP suppresses religion continues through what are known
                    as the “Four Cardinal Principles.” While they do not explicitly condone religious oppression,
                    Georgiou recognizes their ability to “greatly restrict religious freedom” (Georgiou). There is
                    little room for alternative ideological or religious expression in a population that must “adhere to
                    the socialist road, support the people’s democratic dictatorship, follow the leadership of the
                    Communist Party, and take Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong thought as [their] guiding ideology”(China’s
                    Constitution, Art. 51/54). Furthermore, according to Georgiou, the CCP has broad interpretative
                    authority regarding the constitution, meaning the protection of religious freedom―which is defined
                    in the document―is at any point subject to change, or disappear.
                    More tangible efforts to restrict religion are found in government-created organizations, like the
                    Religious Affairs Bureau. Defined by those religious groups that may fall outside of the five
                    recognized religious organizations as a “tool used by the government to destroy [religion],” the
                    Religious Affairs Bureau primarily exists to “regulate [religious organizations’] international
                    affairs” and to relay “[government] directives and policies” to these official institutions
                    (Kolodner). Thus, the extent of government oversight can be traced, in part, to the repressive arms
                    of the CCP that succeed insofar as they can extract information from official religious groups,
                    creating the database that the state relies on to assess the threat of religious movements.
                    However, recognizing the political and humanitarian infeasibility of the total eradication of all
                    religious activity, presently, the state refrains from mercilessly repressing all movements. Adding
                    to the complexity of the Chinese Communist Party’s approach to religious movements, the CCP has
                    allowed some religious activities to flourish―even as they may come dangerously close to resembling
                    a collective authority―if they can extract some form of utility from them. There are four main
                    state-serving functions of religious groups: efficacy, their potential for economic stimulus, the
                    extent to which they can provide social cohesion, and whether their institutional framework allows
                    them to espouse political propaganda.
                    A religious movement’s efficacy is often defined in very ambiguous terms. Typically, the degree to
                    which a religious movement can garner the attention of the Chinese populace, and develop a platform
                    through which they can circulate their ideas contributes significantly to a religious movements
                    efficacy. Ideally, this element of efficacy is conditioned on first, whether the values of the
                    religious activity align with those of the CCP and second, if the organizational structure refrains
                    from impinging on state authority.
                    Expanding on this concept of an efficacious religious movement, it is equally necessary that the
                    movement/activity is malleable to restructurings of its overarching purpose. The state recognizes
                    ‘religion’ as a “Eurocentric” term, which implies that it is not a universal definition. Instead,
                    the Chinese government defines religion in a way that better suits their purpose for it: in terms of
                    “history and education” (Marshall). For all intents and purposes, state-distributed versions of
                    “history and education” likely refer to state efforts to control the information, both historical
                    and present, that the Chinese populace has access to. Therefore, in this power struggle for cultural
                    authority, a religious group will fare better if it allows the state to assume control of any
                    proselytizing efforts. The essence of the religious practice may remain, whether that is tied to a
                    deity, a historical belief, etc., but rejecting an infusion of communist values and state-driven
                    messages is a futile effort. Religious institutions that wish to survive in a state-controlled
                    religious landscape will ensure that power can be shared between religious leaders and Party
                    officials.
                    Hypotheses
                    After analyzing the theoretical, legal, and institutional frameworks through which the CCP represses
                    religious movements, I developed a set of hypotheses. First, the Chinese Communist Party’s
                    supervision of religious movements is complex in that there are unique policy prescriptions for
                    different categories of movements and activities. Moreover, characteristics that usually provide
                    reason for censorship will be overridden if the state can find a positive utility within a religious
                    movement that outweighs the bad. Religious suppression is not arbitrary, nor is it a blanket ban.
                    Atheism may be the official policy of the Party, but when religious institutions can serve Party
                    goals, they will likely receive state support. Second, the CCP’s desire for stability pervades many
                    social aspects of society, which can be concluded through an analysis of CCP control of religious
                    movements. Movements that draw the attention of the state as they begin to display a sort of
                    collective authority will not be allowed to exist unsupervised. Keeping on track with political
                    stability means stamping out any hint of political agitation or disturbances. Finally, historical
                    trends looked upon disfavorably by the state influence how the CCP responds to certain religious
                    activities and practices. Balancing political stability whilst promoting economic growth is a
                    difficult feat, and combining this with the need to maintain modernizing progress in China has
                    resulted in several political disasters. Keen to avoid repeating the more serious mistakes in
                    China’s modern history, it may make political sense to keep running tabs on all religious
                    organizations with the potential to create instability. Furthermore, having achieved considerable
                    modernization in the last few decades, any backwards customs reminiscent of a more traditional China
                    will not last long.
                    Methods
                    Through an analysis of the Chinese Communist Party’s approach to both movements they
                    tolerate/support and those that receive brutal, uncompromising treatment, I pieced together an
                    analysis of the complexity of state policy concerning these religious movements. Expanding on this,
                    I also attempted to assess the extent to which strict regulation of religious movements reflects the
                    strength of the state’s political control. In essence, this begs a question to which the findings of
                    this paper do not fully answer, but seek to provide a comprehensive analysis of: can the Chinese
                    government, with the wealth of data collected on religious activity in China, actually subdue the
                    authoritative threat from religious movements, or does the issue expand beyond their understanding
                    and reach? In striving to answer this question, I have emphasized the magnitude of unauthorized,
                    unregistered religious activity in China, and then analyzed to what extent China’s authoritarian
                    control actually affects these activities. Furthermore, in evaluating these concepts, I have adopted
                    an institutional framework to govern my research. Relevant ideas, such as religious freedom, state
                    supervision/authority, and ideological control constitute this framework, and allow for a more
                    comprehensive and institutional understanding of the relationship between the Chinese state and
                    different religious groups.
                    Findings
                    In Alison Marshall’s paper, “Religion as Culture: Understanding Religious Diversity and Freedom in
                    China and Canada,” she finds that “religious freedom [is] determined by whether it [meets] the
                    practical needs of those in power” (Marshall). In several cases, religious movements can satisfy
                    these needs. First, the state identifies whether a religious movement has efficacy, an often vaguely
                    defined characteristic. However, with some religious deities, like the Jigong cult, which the
                    “Chinese state....regards… as efficacious,” its efficacy is clearly defined by the social and
                    historical relevance it affords to the Chinese populace, and thus, its ability to attract the
                    attention of millions of Chinese (Marshall). By extension, the Jigong deity has been a remarkably
                    successful tourist attraction, and accordingly, provides considerable economic stimulus. Therefore,
                    even though the values promoted by the Jigong deity and the state are far from compatible, overtime,
                    the CCP can gradually work toward a reformed Jigong cult, with a cultural and political message
                    aligning with that of the state. Ironically, the Jigong deity represents a diametrically opposite
                    version of what the state likely wishes their citizenry would pay homage to. Jigong is an
                    independent-minded, unconventional symbol for the segment of the Chinese population who are
                    typically disempowered and feel economically insecure. Though he is a Buddhist deity, he exists
                    outside of typical norms, “drinking, eating meat, gambling, stealing, and fornicating.” Moreover,
                    not only does the Jigong cult typify the rebellious nature the state would normally attempt to
                    eradicate, but it unapologetically “flouts official state culture.” Why, then, have the Jigong cult
                    and the Jinci Temple, in which shrines to the cult are typically housed, not been at the receiving
                    end of the CCP’s familiar religious oppression? In this particular instance, the Jigong cult’s
                    efficacy outweighs the potential for dangerous nonconformity. Furthermore, given that the CCP
                    actually runs the Jinci Temple, theoretically, it can manipulate the message of the Jigong cult, as
                    well as those who proselytize his values, however it wishes. This means that those who engage in
                    mediumship with the Jigong deity or propagate its message will do so within the confines of what the
                    state defines as “legitimate… religious practices,” taking care to “avoid mentioning” any practices
                    that contradict Party values. Gradually, the Chinese government will take this immensely popular
                    religious symbol and “recast Jigong culture and values as official communist ones,” thereby
                    manipulating the religious movement to fit the “practical needs” of the state (Marshall).
                    Another example of an efficacious religious activity is the worship of the goddess of Guanyin. While
                    there is less incredulity in the state’s support of this religious symbol, given her lack of
                    contentious values, the relationship still merits an analysis considering that her veneration might
                    be realistically perceived as a threat to state authority. Guanyin, like the Jigong cult, is a
                    popular attraction for much of the Chinese populace and foreign tourists, satisfying the efficacy
                    requirement for state support--she has created a platform on which the state might manipulate
                    subscribing Chinese citizens. Furthermore, she meets “practical needs and [does] not offend,” likely
                    eliminating the element of restructuring that makes this religious practice an adequate tool for
                    state use. Instead, Chinese citizens tend to gravitate toward this deity in an effort to associate
                    themselves with her values, “purity and vague association with catholicism” (Marshall). The latter
                    part provides an opportunity for stronger relations between the PRC and the West, as well as between
                    the various populations of overseas Chinese and native Chinese communities. Thus, increased outside
                    contact through religious institutions can be facilitated without allowing an encroaching, foreign
                    influence to overstep its bounds in Chinese society.
                    Most importantly, Guanyin promotes the ideal religious institution in China: one that “doesn’t
                    challenge state leadership, values, or goals” (Marshall). In addition, according to Marshall, there
                    is little knowledge about the proper ways to worship this goddess in Chinese society. As a result,
                    the Chinese government has taken a lead role in disseminating the methods through which the Guanyin
                    goddess should be venerated, and thus, manipulates this information in order to “suit state needs”
                    (Marshall).
                    Conversely, where the state finds that a religious group’s collective authority has reached
                    threatening levels, and adding insult to injury, cannot identify any worthy efficacy, the group is
                    officially banned, or declared as xiejiao. Walton finds that recently, in China’s “shifting
                    political environment,” this is particularly relevant. Five characteristics are used by the state to
                    identify these groups, like the “[deification] of core leaders” or the “[organization] of efforts
                    to… conduct other activities” (Ministry of Public Security). Therefore, it isn’t difficult for a
                    religious group to fall out of favor with the CCP. Once identified as a potential threat by the
                    state, a religious movement will have “[caught] the state’s direct attention” and be dealt with
                    accordingly.
                    As previously mentioned, there are five recognized denominations: Buddhism, Daoism, Protestantism,
                    Catholicism, and Islam. While it is not a given that any religious group existing outside of those
                    categories will be harassed or banned, it is neither guaranteed that belonging to one of the five
                    denominations grants a religious group protection. Lay Buddhist movements, even if they “operate
                    within the state registered system for Buddhism,” engage in practices which the state defines as
                    illicit and finds “threatening” (Walton).
                    Other movements, like Qigong, which represents the powerful spiritual motivation of not only Chinese
                    adherents, but followers across the world, garnered enough popularity and unique loyalty to attract
                    the attention of the state. Concerns cited by the state related to the “millennialist aspects” of
                    the movement, its promotion of “spiritual enlightenment,” and the “size and devotion of its
                    following” (Walton). While the argument exists for the difference between spirituality and ideology,
                    the powerful loyalty to a certain belief system evidently poses a challenge to state authority. In
                    this particular instance, where other types of religion, like Guanyin, have a strong following as
                    well as a malleable platform on which to propagate ideas, the strength of the devotion to the
                    spiritual ideas contained within Qigong likely did not present an opportunity for manipulation.
                    Therefore, the Qigong movement was subject to a series of campaigns designed to eliminate the
                    intense group loyalty to the practice.
                    Discussion
                    Clearly, state regulation of religion denotes complexity for several reasons; arguably, the more
                    threatening of these being that there is often no direct indication of which movements will be
                    harassed or repressed, or for what reason. Underlying policy goals, of which provide the foundations
                    for the future of China’s economic and political development, allow us to trace some of the origins
                    of the motivation for repression. However, an authoritarian government, lacking the political
                    institutions that provide a system of checks and balances, can decide at any point in time that a
                    new set of policy goals will govern their actions. More likely, identifying a potential threat to
                    state control will produce a similar about-face in their approach to an organization.
                    However, in recognizing the authoritarian nature of the Chinese government, equal emphasis should be
                    placed on the extent to which China’s controlling measures have maintained the political stability
                    necessary to achieve massive industrial and economic growth. The lens through which we (Americans)
                    often view alternative political systems derives from a set of beliefs and institutions that have
                    been more or less imposed on us, democratic institutions be damned. Our moral imperative then lies
                    in our willingness to recognize the legitimacy of systems that are unlike our own. The ‘Washington
                    Consensus’ differs dramatically from ‘Beijing Consensus’, but these differences should not preclude
                    the recognition of the other system’s merit. What we achieve through democratic institutions, one
                    could argue disables our governing bodies to the extent that progress and economic growth stagnate.
                    Furthermore, has our ‘global superiority’ not been surpassed by the imminence of China’s rapid
                    economic growth?
                    It is necessary to recognize that our political values and beliefs are not the end-all-be-all for
                    modern definitions of a developed state, nor the blueprint for economic growth. The extent to which
                    political control, and its consequent stability, has contributed to China’s miraculous economic
                    development is outside the scope of this paper. However, there is likely an argument to be made for
                    a causal relationship between some degree of political control and economic growth.
                    Conclusion
                    Through an analysis of a unique set of religious movements, it can be determined that the Chinese
                    Communist Party’s policy prescriptions for a variety of religious activities is an advanced effort,
                    which calculates both historical considerations and present political conditions to formulate these
                    policies. Additionally, the extent to which religious regulation is often ambiguously defined gives
                    the CCP broad interpretative authority in not only religious affairs, but in society as well, as it
                    attempts to create an ideological conformity among the Chinese populace.
