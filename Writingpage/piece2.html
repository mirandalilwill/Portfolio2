                <h1>Cock n' Roll: How Queerness Creeps into Homosocial Havens</h1>
                <p>Unifying social forces: [blank], [blank, [blank], [blank] and heavy metal. In many ways an offering
                    of counterculture, heavy metal connects different walks of life by their shared enjoyment of guitars
                    that sound like they’re radioing in from another planet, the primal scream of the modern homosapien,
                    percussion on power-drill mode and some really raw, really powerful, sometimes slightly satanic
                    lyrics. On occasion I will admit that the furious cries of Slipknot can draw the demon out of me.
                    Most of the time, though, the aggression and emotion catches me off guard. If I want to listen to
                    it, I have to reach deeper to empathize with this form of expression, this appeal to the darker side
                    of human existence. Because it can be dark and outright disturbing, and at the same time defiantly
                    real and refreshing. Perhaps that’s why millions of metalheads gather to slam into each other,
                    scream along to the anthems of our disturbed selves and appreciate this emblem of popular culture.
                    For some, it may also provide a haven from the sometimes alienating expectations and structures of
                    mainstream culture. But how unified are the fans of heavy metal beyond their love of the music? The
                    culture’s interwoven complexities of heteronormativity and the pressure queerness puts on them
                    definitely don’t tell a story of perfect unity. Yet they both exist within the culture and are in
                    fact deeply embedded in its foundation. To understand how, we need to revisit the decade it was
                    born, when another form of social reorganization was shifting through the world.</p?>
                <p>Deindustrialization took hold of the U.S and Western Europe in cities like Detroit and Birmingham in
                    the 1970s, as capitalism's never-ending quest for cost-cutting modernization swung into higher gear.
                    In “post-Fordism”, capitalists found cheaper and more efficient sources of production in the
                    vulnerable labor markets of developing countries, and accordingly outsourced production costs to
                    these ‘peripheral’ regions. From 1971 to 1984, Britain saw a decline from 8 million manufacturing
                    jobs to 5.5 million (Bayer). Indeed, the modality of capitalist expansion relies on an indefinite
                    restructuring of the production process to constantly advance the accumulation of capital. Class
                    consciousness and labor solidarity stand little chance against the offensive arm of capital. And
                    because so much of the manufacturing industry was associated with conventional manifestations of
                    masculinity in the 1970s—“production, muscle, and the mastery of heavy machinery”—simultaneous with
                    deindustrialization, a crisis of masculinity ensued. Women entered the workforce in greater numbers
                    to accommodate the need for more service-oriented roles, causing a disruptive shift in the workplace
                    makeup—long-considered a traditionally homosocial environment. Combined with the increasing “overall
                    visibility of the feminist movement…the job losses and downward mobility…emasculated working-class
                    men” (Bayer).</p>
                <p>Where the consequences of deindustrialization deconstructed an essential part of the masculine
                    identity, heavy metal subculture stepped in to fill this emasculated void. In appropriating themes
                    from 1960s counterculture—“long-hair, dope, loud music, lessened inhibitions about sex, inherent
                    suspicion of authority, and passive indifference to achievement”—it also resisted the utopian and
                    naturalist vision of the 1960s (Bayer). Instead, this culture reflected a different version of
                    disillusionment, embracing xenophobia, hypermasculine and patriarchal gender-roles, and chafing
                    against expressions of racial and sexual differences. The disillusionment that was catalyzed by
                    deindustrialization was only amplified by the fear that a more equal and accepting society would
                    further exacerbate the threat to white, male privilege. Heavy metal, both in the actual music and
                    the subculture, offered a way to reify this disillusionment. The sounds of distorted guitars and
                    angry screams recall the most primal expressions of manhood, and champion an extreme version of
                    masculinity that can confront the threat to it (Rogers, p. 3). This reification expanded to include
                    mythical conceptions of those unseen capitalist forces responsible for the undoing of working-class
                    masculinity— laissez-faire, the invisible hand, globalization etc. But these ambiguous forces of
                    capitalism were not as easy to identify as they were occurring, which unfortunately prevented an
                    awakened class-consciousness from being born into heavy metal music. In short, “they knew they were
                    screwed, but it was hard to articulate why” (Bayer).</p>
                <p>While the origins of heavy metal are undeniably homosocial (like the broader genre of rock), heavy
                    metal has developed to accommodate and support other gender identities and sexual orientations in
                    both fans and performers. A changing level of consciousness and broader conceptions about
                    masculinity are definitely on the rise. Yet the gendered nature of heavy metal still positions
                    itself quite sharply on one end of the spectrum. Deindustrialization was interpreted as
                    emasculation, not a realization of class consciousness, so its origins lay clearly in promoting the
                    trappings of the male identity. It was born as a homosocial haven. Homosociality is defined as
                    members of the same gender interacting in non-romantic ways, and is typically studied as it relates
                    to men (Rogers, p. 8-9). Basically, homosociality is just the patriarchy with no ‘other’ gender to
                    function as a target of oppression or opposition to the reigning order. To give wider social
                    context, it helps to compare other homosocial environments. While there are few examples of truly
                    homosocial environments in this age of greater inclusion, fraternity culture on college campuses,
                    male professional sports leagues, some workplaces, and street gangs are a few examples that still
                    pass as relatively homosocial environments. How women who either actively participate in these
                    groups or are indirectly related to them, perform their gender and get stereotyped draws specific
                    parallels with the environment of heavy metal subculture. For example, in my university’s greek life
                    system, fraternities constitute are homosocial environment with immense privilege to control the
                    broader social scene in which sororities operate on the periphery. In professional sports leagues,
                    female teams have to be referred to as female in order to separate them from an inherently masculine
                    environment. They have to prove their legitimacy both for viewership and equal pay.</p>
                <p>Whether it’s homosociality of heavy metal that promotes its hypermasculinity or the hypermasculinity
                    of heavy metal that promotes its homosociality is a difficult and obviously circular question.
                    However, the inherent homosociality of heavy metal likely attracts the membership of men that are
                    predisposed to misogynistic views, escalating both the hypermasculinity of the culture as well as
                    its homosociality because of their exclusionary position toward women. Not only does it tend towards
                    exclusiveness in order to preserve its hegemonic masculinity, but this leads to the objectification
                    of women who wish to enter the space. Objectification is highly typical in hypermasculine
                    environments—it is a product of searching for compensatory power. Recalling that heavy metal
                    originates in disillusioned masculinity, men in this context view women through the prism of how
                    they threaten an established gender hierarchy. By extension, women who participate in heavy metal
                    culture are either implicitly or explicitly pressured to ‘perform their gender’ in order to appease
                    this established order. While many subgenres of heavy metal, in their rejection of mainstream social
                    conventions, offer spaces for women to resist some gender norms, still, “there remains a distinct
                    need to continue to do gender on men’s terms” (Rogers, p. 30).</p>
                <p>So what does it mean to ‘do’ or ‘perform’ gender? According to Judith Butler’s theory on gender
                    performativity, “through social cues and training practices” both biologically-sexed men and women
                    are socially-conditioned to perform their gender and act out a largely unconscious set of behaviors
                    (that will likely remain unconscious due to its deep social entrenchment). These ‘performances’ are
                    acted out in what Butler identifies as a “heteronormative matrix”, a structure that constructs
                    metaphorical boxes of appropriate gender expression and behavior into the population’s psyche. We
                    gravitate toward this conception of normality in order to over-simplify and oppress any expression
                    that deviates from this easily-understood binary, and thus we “idealize heterosexuality as being
                    biologically ‘normal’.” Once these sex-based cues and practices are established, “people will go
                    about their entire lives ‘doing’ these gender performances” (Butler and Rogers).</p>
                <p>What this means for women entering the space of heavy metal is a careful balancing act of “acting
                    like a man” and “looking like a woman” (Rogers, p. 31). From the study conducted by Anna Rogers and
                    Mathieu Deflem of the “Perceptions on Women in a Hypermasculine Subculture,” a theme that was
                    prevalent in a set of interviews they conducted was female fans of heavy metal being implicitly and
                    explicitly required to prove their authenticity as metal fans. Anecdotes from female interviewees
                    referencing how they have to “know what [they’re] talking about, know the bands” or getting asked
                    where their boyfriend is by other audience members were common. Many women were assumed to be in
                    attendance not for the music, but to engage in the hyper feminine act of flashing, to “make gaga
                    eyes at the band members”, or to be perceived as cool. One way in which women can ‘prove’ themselves
                    in heavy metal groups is through the act of moshing, to basically engage in a hypermasculine
                    practice that displays a lesser regard for women in order to be taken seriously. (Rogers, p. 48).
                    Indeed, while there are mixed perception on moshing both by insiders and outsiders of heavy metal
                    culture, it is still perceived as a “haven of male homosocial interactions” (Rogers, p. 25).</p>
                <p>In a similar vein, another form of acceptance exists in women ‘othering’ themselves from other women,
                    by refusing to ‘do’ their gender according to the conventions of the heterosexual matrix in order to
                    not be ‘othered’ by men. Essentially, they “establish a counter-universe, [which is] always set up
                    within the frame of the masculine universe” (Beauvoir, p. 597). This is referred to as defensive
                    othering, which mirrors a competitive, athletic framework in which women adopt masculine trappings,
                    “creating a boundary” to ‘other’ themselves against women who display more traditionally feminine
                    qualities (Rogers, p. 19). In more homosocial environments, women experience more explicit
                    indications that they should either perform their gender or distance themselves from it in order
                    receive credit from men who dominate the gender structure. Particularly, defensive othering further
                    perpetuates this structure by “reaffirming (men’s) existing stereotypes about how women should do
                    their gender” (Rogers, p. 21).</p>
                <p>The implications of homosocial, hypermasculine environments extend beyond their control or exclusion
                    of women. Homosocial environments often breed high levels of homophobia. This dated trapping of
                    traditional masculinity has been drawn out of heavy metal culture by the media to portray its
                    bloated, often toxic hypermasculinity. Indeed, Kerry King, the vocalist for a very well-known heavy
                    metal band, Slayer, has been criticized over the years for his alarming sexism and homophobia.
                    Inevitably, he became the target of a #MeToo movement within the heavy metal community, known as
                    #KillTheKing (a term originally coined by the movement, Metal Against Racism). To be clear, the
                    sexism and homophobia of heavy metal does not originate solely from this one man, he fronts one of
                    the most popular modern metal bands, and is therefore an important figure to target—similar to how
                    powerful figures of Hollywood were singled-out in the original #MeToo movement. Sweden has erected
                    its own #MeToo movement, as female heavy metal fans draw parallels from their experience in heavy
                    metal culture, “now is the time to end this male dominance; now is the time to starting [sic]
                    treating women and nonbinary individuals as equals.” They have created spaces for women to
                    anonymously report their experiences of sexual assault and harassment committed by band members as
                    well as metal fans. When an extreme heavy metal band, Destroyer 666, came to perform in the Swedish
                    hometown of the movement, the band’s frontman, K.K. Warslut, had a message for them, “some women in
                    this country have a problem with us. I know what they need. Hard dick! Fuck these political cunt
                    suckers. This song is dedicated to the cunts in Kill the King.” Nice.</p>
                <p>Not only is Kerry King identified as one of the most homophobic figures in heavy metal, it is also
                    theorized that his homosexuality is an expression of homosexual panic. In more recent versions of
                    queer theory, “shame [and] mockery” have been identified as ways to “feel queer” (Clifford).</p>
                <p>Arguably, King does not demonstrate the complexity of this homosocial culture more than Rob Halford.
                    Amber Clifford-Napolean argues in , that heavy metal is “not masculine at all” (Clifford). Here’s
                    why. In 1998, Rob Halford, the vocalist of Judas Priest came out as gay, shocking the heavy metal as
                    well as the broader rock ‘n’ roll community, though his bandmate, Ian Hill, wrote that it “must have
                    been the worst kept secret in rock and roll” (Clifford). In heavy metal history, Halford is largely
                    credited with, if not introducing and widely popularizing, the use of leather and spikes in heavy
                    metal dress, which he appropriated from the gay leather subculture of San Francisco. Within this
                    matrix of heteronormativity, a misread expression of sexual-orientation (although it was not
                    intentionally such an expression) demonstrates the power of the gender structure to “selectively
                    interpret homoeroticly-loaded cues in such a fashion that metal’s hegemonic masculinity went
                    unthreatened” (Clifford). So is the hypermasculinity and homosociality of heavy metal culture
                    actually a front? Does queer expression actually lay the foundations for some of heavy metal’s most
                    prominent cultural themes?</p>
                <p>According to Amber Clifford-Napolean in Queerness in Heavy Metal Music: Metal Bent, the mainstream
                    translation of heavy metal as an inherently masculine and heteronormative is catergorically false,
                    citing the numerous examples of queer origins that heavy metal culture hails from. No
                    heteronormative bind placed on a culture can negate its queerness. The fluidity of the identity and
                    the expansion of the genre through multiple subgenres, she argues, points to a clear queering of a
                    culture that is incorrectly assumed to be strictly heteronormative. But the prevailing scholarship
                    on heavy metal says otherwise. There are three primary assumptions of heavy metal and most other
                    subgenres of rock that categorize them as overarchingly masculine and heteronormative: “rock (and
                    consequently heavy metal) is sexually exclusive, [that] fans are assumed to be heterosexual, and
                    [that] queer performers and fans are positioned as oddities” (Clifford, p. 12). What stands in clear
                    opposition to these assumptions is the fact that there are multitudes of queer communities and queer
                    performers representing in heavy metal culture. Perhaps, it is this aforementioned
                    oversimplification of gender relations that induces a broad categorization of heavy metal which
                    mainstream scholarship can only understand as homosocial and hypermasculine.</p>
                <p>Clearly, there are several threads of study and multiple theories on the origins and present culture
                    of heavy metal, denoting it as a diverse and rich culture that cannot be oversimplified to fit
                    neatly into one category. Nonetheless, heavy metal is an extension of rock culture, and rock ‘n’
                    roll is a microcosm of the patriarchal structure that orders us into gendered boxes. In this way,
                    although heavy metal was born from a rejection of authority and search for alternative symbols of
                    power, many prominent aspects of its culture still pay respect to this hierarchy of gender.
                    Accordingly, we see a playing out of the struggle against institutional sexism, misogyny, and
                    intolerance of sexual differences within the heavy metal culture that mirrors our broader society.
                    Women and non-men are forced to play this game in multiple schemes in heavy metal culture. Through
                    the intolerances of a homosocial environment and hypermasculinity, women morph and restructure the
                    expression of their gender in order to ‘fit in’, and to simply appreciate the music as any male
                    heavy metal fan does. It is, according to the theory of gender performativity, a predictable outcome
                    considering the broader context of our gendered society, which implies there is a very clear right,
                    and wrong, way to ‘do’ gender.</p>
                <p>In the words of Emmy Sjöström of the #KillTheKing movement, “Metal has always been about going
                    against the grain. If you look at what happens around the world, it’s this toxic masculinity taking
                    over everywhere, racism and misogyny everywhere. It is metal’s place to stand up against that. If
                    you want to be metal and anti-establishment, you should not just play into that role of being this
                    ‘alpha male.’ You should fucking go with us, because this is obviously something that is provocative
                    to people, and metal is supposed to be provocative. In that sense, we are doing everything right”
