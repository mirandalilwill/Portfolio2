                <h1>Golden Seeds of Destruction</h1>
                <h2>10 minute read</h2>
                <p class="part-indicator">Part I.</p>
                <p>In April of 2020, shortly after returning home to Texas to finish my second semester at Bucknell
                    University from my computer in my dad’s house, I knew I would need an escape from the claustrophobia
                    that is moving back in with your parents. I found that escape fast, a flight to northern California
                    to do some farming. Fifty miles inland from the township of Mendocino county, there is a small
                    cannabis farm growing with a hard-earned permit. Cultivating on only 10,000 square feet, the entire
                    property spans 40 acres, much of it bare, blackened pines that burned in the Mendocino Complex fire
                    of 2017. There was a trailer I could stay in, the owner told me over the phone. He didn’t say
                    anything about a shower or toilets and I didn’t ask. I asked to come for the summer, hoping, as we
                    all did, that the pandemic would subside in a few months and I would return to college for the fall
                    semester. Six months later, after living happily in a shed and working from sunrise til noon, when
                    the heat drove me to to take refuge from the afternoon sun in the Russian River, I found myself
                    closing down the farm for the season and storing away a harvest of roughly 400 pounds of cannabis.
                    Lost in the intrigue of northern California and intent on avoiding a dreary, Pennsylvania winter of
                    classes from my dorm room, I postponed another semester and journeyed further east, deeper into the
                    heart of the northern California’s informal cannabis industry. I landed in Nevada City, the historic
                    capital of the Gold Rush.</p>
                <p>Closer to the Sierra Nevada mountains, where the pines grow thicker and the river current runs a
                    little stronger, the air of Nevada County seems to hold more moisture—a relief from the dust and
                    shadeless flats where I had previously worked the land. But the theme of water scarcity never trails
                    far behind, and neither do the wildfires. They racked the state that year until the August Complex
                    fire, who breathed smoke down my lungs for the better half of the summer and fall, broke state
                    records at 1,032,648 acres burned. Indeed, at that point I was well-accustomed to stashing an
                    emergency bag and fire-extinguisher in my trunk. I had even learned how to use a chainsaw to clear
                    the road in case a fallen tree blocked my path out—a nightmare that burns painfully real in the
                    memory of my old boss, who recovered the body of his neighbor’s child in the aftermath of a fire
                    just three years prior.</p>
                <p>I happily traded the smoke-filled air of Mendocino for the clearer waters of the Yuba River and the
                    Dogwood pines lining her banks—they were a welcome respite from the harsh reality of farming in
                    California. So was the endearing culture of artistic expression that had sprung up in the
                    surrounding hills of Nevada City and Grass Valley, free-thinking people practicing hot yoga,
                    cultivating cannabis, living in perfect harmony etc… Maybe that paints a little too idyllic of a
                    picture. An industry carved up by venturing capitalists and relaxed hippies, all backed into small
                    corners of the forest by the overbearing arm of government surveillance, comes with some heavy
                    baggage. The many hard truths of the culture that I was exposed to—sometimes more than I cared to
                    be—could fill a book. But I was falling off the edge of my seat, deep into the scene. By the time my
                    unfinished economics degree and the community I had built back at campus called me back for my
                    senior year, I struggled to leave it all behind. California was like a movie I couldn’t take my eyes
                    off of. One in which the characters are somehow more interesting than the actual plot, which
                    deconstructs a bit more at every cryptic turn and dramatic twist. Wrapping up a story like that
                    wasn’t easy.</p>
                <p>With California still on my mind when I returned to school after the summer, I resisted taking
                    economics course that I knew would ignore the narrative of individuals. I had lost much of my
                    original interest in a field of study too reliant on simplified models of human interaction, but I
                    had empty credits to fill. So I enrolled in a culminating experience class, one of the final
                    requirements to complete my major: The History of American Economics. The professor who taught it
                    had become a favorite of mine when two years earlier, she introduced me to the writings of Marx in
                    her political economy class, rocking my brain and its small world. In The History of American
                    Economics, we started with the economies of Native American populations and followed the thread of
                    capitalist accumulation and its proceeding destruction from there. Through studying ARCGIS map data,
                    I paid close attention as the demographic makeup of the U.S. shifted in favor of white, European
                    settlers. From [some date] to [some date] the population of Native Americans dwindled from
                    [population number] to [population number]. The astronomical loss of Native American life set a grim
                    tone for the study of the rest of our young economy’s life. Indeed, integrating the stories of
                    individuals in the study of economics puts shameless destruction, often marked as celebrated
                    innovation, on raw display. </p>
                <p>I thought back to the previous year of my life in California, a state with one of the most originally
                    diverse and numerous populations of Native Americans, and today, with one of the most carved-up
                    landscapes in the US. I was moved to know California before the hundreds of thousands of fields of
                    mono-crops and droughts brought her to the will of a hungry and greedy American population. To that
                    end, I based the independent research unit for the class on drawing contrasts between a California
                    that supported only Native American human-life in prior to 1769 when the Spanish first colonized the
                    state and one after the first discovery of Gold was made in 1848.</p>
                <p>In excluding the period between initial colonial settlement in 1769 and the discovery of gold, the
                    scope of this comparison has some limitations. Without a doubt, the ecology had already been deeply
                    disturbed prior to the discovery of gold in California. Beginning in 1769 the harmonious
                    relationship Native Americans had cultivated with the land, indicative of a people attuned to the
                    needs of not only themselves but the natural world, was deconstructing rapidly. For the sake of
                    brevity and a cleaner comparison, however, I chose to exclude this period. I wanted to rely more on
                    what I had personally witnessed, which fell closer to the tree of capitalist accumulation, U.S.
                    style. When economic interests brought us to California in 1848, we moved quickly to suppress a
                    culture and genocide a people. Unsurprisingly, the environment has not responded with the buoyancy
                    we expect from all things that are born from capitalism. Like our ‘robust’ economic system, the
                    delicate ecology of California is hanging by a thread.</p>


                <p class="part-indicator">Part II.</p>

                <p>Prior to the introduction of foreign microbes and species via pre-colonial European expeditions and
                    then the direct colonization by the Spanish, Native Californians had developed a special
                    relationship with the land. Contradicting popular belief that indigenous populations undertook
                    little alteration to the land, they actually changed the natural landscape quite significantly. Yet
                    the way they reshaped their natural environment was not predicated on destruction in order to
                    accommodate their needs. Rather, an indigenous, ancestral relationship with the land gave them
                    specific knowledge geared towards creating an environment of accommodation as well as abundance.
                    They perfected methods of pruning, tilling, coppicing, transplanting, and periodic burns to support
                    the abundance that the land would yield. To maintain the health of California’s varied grasslands,
                    Native Americans periodically burned large areas of perennial grasses to promote their growth, which
                    white settlers, upon encountering burned grassland, incorrectly identified as the careless burning
                    of perfectly arable land. In fact, after thousands of years of inhabiting this land, the environment
                    actually relied on their curated human disturbance to maintain its ecological balance. Native
                    Americans were the keystone species, which was clearly indicated by the damage to California’s
                    ecology after their relationship with the land was abruptly severed.</p>
                <p>Today, cultural burning has regained appreciation. What set the stage for a renewed interest in
                    intentional burning? Only the excessive destruction of the fire season that has gripped many western
                    states since the 19th century. Although reliable data is scant before the year of 1983, it’s clear
                    that wildfires had already begun to terrorize California summers well before this date; destruction
                    was ramping up steadily, with or without the exact numbers. Eventually pressure mounted a
                    policy-reversal from the state government in the 1970s. Calfire, the state’s aggressively large
                    fire-fighting task force, finally adopted prescribed burns, burning brush in state forests in an
                    effort to reduce the spread and destruction of wildfires. This enlightenment came a little too late,
                    however. Now the fire season burns past the summer, stoking fear all year long until the
                    long-awaited rain falls—and usually much later than expected. Approximately 20 million acres of
                    California have been burned since 1979 to 2017. That’s an average of almost 2 million acres per
                    year. While the state has now admitted that criminalizing intentional burns was a mistake, in the
                    first part of the 20th century, barring access to Native Americans’ traditional methods of
                    cultivation and criminalizing their nurturing relationship with nature was a way to fast track their
                    starvation and depopulation. Messaging from the federal government first brought about the narrative
                    of fire suppression: “Only YOU can prevent wildfires.” Smokey Bear’s influential catchphrase might
                    have found more resonance with the massive agriculture and mining companies that were and are
                    responsible for creating a climate and landscape more favorable to destructive wildfires.</p>
                <p>Cultural burning is not just about burning vegetation that results in milder fires, but promoting
                    healthy plant growth, particularly for perennials. For millennia, plants in California were
                    subjected to burns, either by fires started by lightning or indigenous tribes. In Contested Eden:
                    California Before the Gold Rush, a book on various elements of California’s environment and culture,
                    scholars of California’s history, Ramón Guitiérez and Richard Orsi, describe how deliberate burning
                    “was the major management tool used to shape California’s landscapes”. Plant ecology thrives on
                    periodic burns, which Native Americans understood to be a key element of human disturbance in
                    supporting California’s abundant ecosystem. Equally, eliminating ground vegetation in the winter
                    prepared the forests for dry fall and summer seasons, and minimized the risk of the high seasonal
                    temperatures that make fires more likely.</p>
                <p>The relationship that the indigenous had created with the land was mutualistic, and arguably, more
                    sustainable. That is, it would have been more sustainable had it existed outside of a world in which
                    conquest of nature and subjectively weaker groups of people are values that the progress of our
                    planet is invested in. Europeans were indeed correct in identifying a climate that would be
                    suitable, even superior, to host plant and animal species from their mother countries—California is
                    a Mediterranean climate. Yet they neglected to give back to the land in proportion to what they took
                    from it. This is the frame of the ensuing conflict in land use and habitation that arose between
                    white settlers and Native Americans. What Europeans (and their descendants) viewed as necessary
                    alterations to the land in order to support their existence and progress, Native Americans viewed as
                    horrific destruction to the abundant ecology they had successfully maintained for centuries.
                    European colonialists did not happen upon a pristine wilderness in the 18th century simply inhabited
                    by another human population, but a garden, that Native Americans had cultivated with attention to
                    balancing an ecological diversity that relied on their existence. </p>
                <p>It’s not hard to understand why careless environmental degradation accompanied the rush to California
                    after the discovery of gold. Had environment as a term, as a concept, even been introduced into
                    American language at this point? Not quite, environmentalism took hold in the United States as late
                    as the 1960s. For many during this time, the ‘environment’ might as well have been analogous to the
                    ‘land’, confined to its conception as a resource to be farmed, mined, altered, and commodified.
                    Fetishizing progress, future-oriented, and blinded by their divine push westward, this frontiering
                    population relegated conservation and preservation to the background. Although much of the
                    environmental damage that would throw California’s delicate ecology into heavier droughts and
                    destructively long fire seasons began to occur before the Gold Rush (with the introduction of Old
                    World species, diseases, and farming practices), the Gold Rush itself was arguably the worst
                    indicator of environmental destruction in California. The greed that motivated this ruthless
                    exploitation of people and land was relentless.</p>
                <p>However, this initial rush to California in search of gold did not immediately meet expectations.
                    Many companies and individuals arriving from the East Coast quickly gave up and disbanded after
                    exhausting the readily available gold reserves, indicating that heavier machinery and more capital
                    would be required to tap into the promised reserves that called them out West. Enter hydraulic
                    mining. Driving along Tyler Foote Crossing Road off Highway 40 on the San Juan Ridge, north of
                    Nevada City, one can see the scars that hydraulic mining left before the industry was regulated. The
                    washed hillsides and cratered landscapes are a window into the age, though the eerily beautiful,
                    aquamarine pools placidly hide a history of destroying Native American cultural sites, polluting
                    water sources, and rapacious resource extraction. Mining activities likely raised the Yuba river bed
                    fifty feet higher than pre-hydraulic mining levels, destroying a habitat for a once abundant trout
                    that indigenous populations in that area subsisted on. In fact, Bullards Bar, a popular boating and
                    recreation reservoir with suspiciously beautiful clear water, (in which nothing grows nor swims) is
                    actually one of those craters, originally created to hold toxic mining waste and prevent it from
                    flowing down the Yuba river and flooding the Sacramento. Indeed, the great Sacramento flood of 1862,
                    which occurred because of mining activities up north, did not incite political action against
                    hydraulic mining until 1884, when agricultural interests inevitably won out against mining ones
                    (Rawls).</p>
                <p>Now, the intrigue of the Sierra Nevadan foothills lies in the thousands of illicit cannabis grows
                    scattered along the ridge and throughout the county. Extraction and exploitation breed more of the
                    same. Although, the inhabitants might not use those words— rather, it’s a celebrated identity that
                    holds cultural value for the area. Nevada City (the township of Nevada County) lays proud claim to
                    being the historical capital of the Gold Rush. This claim to fame that ripples out to the fringes in
                    the surrounding foothills, promises, at the very least, a life of intrigue and small ‘a’ anarchy.
                    Although the mountain-dwelling, white Rastafarians are not the same ‘rugged individuals’ of the Gold
                    Rush era, they are of a similar ‘strike-it-rich’ mentality. They give character to the rush of
                    cannabis grows, all struggling to profit from a tired, depleted land that has little left to give.
                    The same water scarcity that drove hydraulic mining ventures to drain wetland habitats is still a
                    painfully ironic feature of many types of agriculture in California today. In the rapidly growing
                    cannabis industry, a diva cash crop that relies on exorbitant amounts of water that just isn’t there
                    recalls similar torments to the delicate ecology of the state.</p>
                <p>Water scarcity is of little deterrent to cannabis farming, however, which leaves one questioning the
                    recreational necessity of the product. Every three days for three rainless seasons, I awaited the
                    arrival of a semi-truck hauling water from who-knows-where to to the top of a dusty hill where the
                    farm, originally permitless, hid from the government’s war on plants. I felt that no place I would
                    live after that could ever rain enough to erase the dryness that I felt in my bones, in my mouth and
                    in the air. Yet when our water delivery service came to fill the three thousand-gallon water tanks,
                    I watered the plants before I washed myself. It all felt so important. In the end, the cannabis
                    market was so flooded after that season that I’m not sure if the farm could even sell a quarter of
                    what it grew. Farming is a financially and resource intensive endeavor, however. Once you’ve stepped
                    far enough into it, it’s hard to pull out, even if all signs point to a resource-stressed future
                    that’s impossible to sustain. Nevertheless, capitalism does not rely on sustainability to prove it’s
                    case. That’s why California is bleeding.</p>


                <p class="part-indicator">Part III.</p>

                <p>To understand white American hostility towards the Natives of California, one must recall over two
                    hundred years of history between white Americans and the indigenous of the Northeast, from where the
                    forty-niners came. Displacement and dispossession were already the norm upon encountering new groups
                    of indigenous in the West. Accordingly, so was indigenous defiance of white settlements and defense
                    of their land.</p>
                <p>In the style of primitive accumulation, the forty-niners began dispossessing first peoples of their
                    land, and simultaneously created a vulnerable population from which they could extract labor. In the
                    early stages of the Gold Rush, many indigenous Californians participated in mining activities either
                    voluntarily or by force. Although is was clear that the influx of greedy prospectors were out to
                    displace them and plunder California’s resources, Native Californians participated in the madness;
                    maintaining their traditional lifestyle and living in peaceful coexistence with the new culture
                    wasn’t a part of the question. But this superficial cooperation didn’t last. Deep-seated racism
                    emboldened the white settlers to define a racial hierarchy. Natives working alongside whites in the
                    mines were viewed as greedy and undeserving of any wealth. Treaties, ‘negotiated’ with Native
                    Americans about their land habitation and usage, removed them from the majority of their indigenous
                    lands. Yet this wasn’t enough; even a small plot of a productive resource was too generous of a
                    concession for “ignorant savages.” Without legal recourse nor advocates (besides themselves), Native
                    Americans took to raiding white settlements and mines in an effort to drive some space between
                    themselves and the white intruders. Unsurprisingly, the whites only found more justification to
                    scale up their indiscriminate harassment, which drove the state’s first peoples off their land and
                    into the mountains. Out of sight was not out of mind, however. With the threat of raids still
                    looming, California appropriated millions of dollars to state militias in a merciless mission to
                    round up uncooperating Natives and return them to their designated reservations. The context was
                    clear. White settlers had displaced Native people, the “original possessors of the soil,” as one
                    account from 1851 offers in a moment of clarity. Yet the cloud of of greed and exploitation, the
                    threat of not surviving in a free-for-all capitalist system, drove whites to deliver a scapegoat.
                    Othering is typical of unevenly hierarchical capitalism. And it’s usually the vulnerable population
                    that is held responsible for the injustices inherent in this system (Trafzer).</p>
                <p>“An Act for the Government and Protection of Indians” spells out the inferiority with which white
                    settlers saw Native Americans. Decisions over what land Native Americans were allowed to exist on
                    were left to the courts, an undeniably racist and unforgiving institution of the time. In this act,
                    provisions made Native Americans vulnerable to arbitrary detention for “loitering and strolling
                    about” and allowed white settlers to basically enslave them by giving whites the ownership of their
                    labor in exchange for paying the fine. As the scapegoat, they were looped into a circular and unjust
                    narrative—a theme that has not disappeared in the following centuries. The ability of white people
                    to define the narrative of the other easily allowed them to subjugate, dispossess, and ultimately
                    destroy the other. Dozens of accounts from the early years of the Gold Rush settlement characterize
                    Native Americans as savage and murderous. When the instigator was unclear in a particularly
                    conflict, natives were easily blamed, escalating their vulnerability from a passive, exploitable
                    human resource to a unmanageable threat that needed to be exterminated. Literally, “Exterminate
                    them!” are the words white settlers hurled as they incited a genocide against all Native Americans
                    living in California. A successful endeavor to say the least, Native Americans declined eighty
                    percent in the twenty years following the discovery of gold in California.</p>
                <p>In an article from the Daily Alta in 1851, a new settler wrote, “ God has give us in California a
                    goodly heritage… her future must be greater than her past.” The settler dreams of a future in which
                    California’s hills are covered in buildings, the pristine bay becomes a busy port; and the fertile
                    soils and prairie lands have only yet to be “turned by the plowshare of the husbandmen.” This
                    “extensive range of mining country”, he writes, “was once the habitation of the wild Indian.”</p>
                <p>Certainly, California’s proceeding industrialization was a whirlwind of development in the following
                    decades. Behind this development, however, are the lands stolen, the cultures destroyed, and a
                    people displaced, dispossessed and dehumanized. In a capitalist relation of production, there are
                    the exploiting and the exploited. Once a group of people are stripped of the things that construct
                    their identity, they are easily grouped into commodified units of labor. Once the land, the trees,
                    the animals, the lakes and the rivers became governed by those blind to their history and connecting
                    force, they too were stripped of their worth beyond a commodified value. Capitalism tells us that
                    our relationship with nature is not mutualistic. The relationship is defined first, by how it can be
                    objectified, and then how it can be extracted from. While it was inappropriate to burn the land for
                    cultivation and wildfire management, it was acceptable to wash away entire hillsides, drill tunnels
                    through mountains, and flood lakes and rivers with sediment from mining. Habitat destruction is just
                    another input in production.</p>
                <p>It has taken centuries for us to welcome the narrative of Native Americans back into our discourse.
                    After a couple of hundred years of careless industrial and agricultural activity, California has
                    possibly reached a point of desperation. When the frontier was new; when the possibilities of
                    discovering treasure abounded; when the hills weren’t yet covered in buildings; when thousands of
                    old growth trees were still standing; when the bay hadn’t yet become an international port; when the
                    supply of water didn’t threaten to disappear; the opportunities might have seemed endless. After
                    all, the model of capitalism relies on an infinite supply of resources to define its existence in an
                    ever-undefinable future. Now that the future has caught up with us, however, groups of landowners
                    team up with indigenous tribes to coordinate cultural burns ahead of the fire season; a
                    certification in permaculture is a respected professional accreditation; and people dedicate their
                    lives to preserving natural landscapes and resources. While our national concern has certainly
                    developed in more ways than just industrially, it still chafes considerably against bigger and
                    better-funded interests that care less about correcting our history of rapacious consumption and
                    destruction. That’s why we have to continue to speak about it. There is always something to learn
                    and a way to do things differently, especially when the key voices with knowledge and expertise of
                    the alternative have been cut out of the dialogue.</p>
