                <h1>More Rantings About Capitalism</h1>
                <p>If the predictors of economic future were simple, one-dimensional pieces of an economic system,
                    mainstream economics—sometimes referred to as a pseudoscience—would have merit. However, rarely does
                    any piece of the economy fit correctly into a mathematical model. Humans and various institutions
                    are not formulaic structures with straightforward motivations, but are instead constantly evolving
                    with varied motivations and intentions. In mainstream economics, these variations have been
                    corrected for by assigning predictability to a limited set of factors that influence economic
                    outcomes. By removing variations from the study of economics, mainstream economics also removes an
                    array of negative externalities and even some classes of people, which by their very exclusion, are
                    suffering from the current conditions of the economy.
                    Heterodox economics, on the other hand, employs a more holistic approach to the study of the economy
                    which, if this ‘science’ purports to analyze human behavior, is essential. Questions of why one of
                    the richest nations in the world continues to deny many of its citizens a decent standard of living
                    are only answerable by taking into consideration political and historical influences that interact
                    to create such barriers to an improved quality of life. In recognizing that equal opportunity is not
                    actually a tenet of American capitalism, heterodox economics uses theories of class reproduction and
                    power structures to explain pervasive economic inequality, which in turn, explains social and
                    political imbalances. Furthermore, this theory of economics not only enumerates economic problems as
                    they exist, but explains their historical, institutional roots and thus, the reason behind their
                    intractability.
                    In William Dugger and James Peach’s article “Abundance Denied: Consequences of the Great Recession,”
                    they explain how most corporate decision as well as economic policies are predicated on what
                    conditions will create profit. Therefore, during the 2008 crisis, government policies designed to
                    “[reduce] the severity of the recession” did not mean reducing the severity for the majority of the
                    population, but ensuring that financial conglomerates could continue as they were. Moreover, in most
                    sectors of the economy, “losses in production occurred,” as they must in a competitive economy
                    experiencing a crisis. Should it be of any concern that cutting off production or injecting economic
                    stimulus into Wall Street bulge bracket banks does nothing for millions of citizens suffering—more
                    than financial institutions are—from an economic downturn? Not according to mainstream economics.
                    Fiscal and monetary policies are designed to ‘stop the bleeding,’ but only for the most important
                    economic actors. In the long-run, the self-regulating economy should take care of the rest (Dugger).
                    However, mainstream economics ignores the fact that the ‘inevitable’ correction is not simply a
                    replica of the previous recovery, or the one before that. Each successive long swing in our
                    capitalist system is progressively more imbalanced—each contraction becomes stronger and
                    necessarily, each expansion will be weaker. Mainstream economic theory doesn’t recognize this trend,
                    instead pointing to the tired solution of internal, self-regulating stabilizers. What happens, then,
                    when the purchasing power of the consumer class can no longer compensate for losses in business
                    profit?
                    Therein lies one of the many reasons that justifies heterodox economics’ relevancy. While
                    overproduction and risky speculation no doubt contribute to economic destabilization, Bowles et al
                    emphasize “the poverty and restricted consumption of the masses” as the “ultimate reason for all
                    crises” (Bowles). However, although a holistic perspective on how the economy function defines the
                    problem—and the solution—very clearly, the institutional structures in the economy prevent the
                    realization of this solution. Severe wealth and income inequality will always provide the basis for
                    economic crises. That a market system does not work if demand and supply can’t reach an equilibrium
                    because demand is perpetually weakened is exactly the point. Yet we make excuses for it, reminding
                    those who point to the obvious disconnect that it is not only a fixed and acceptable tenet of this
                    system, but a fair one, too. It’s fair in the same sense that European colonizers were justified in
                    brutally suppressing indigenous populations simply because they recognized an opportunity for
                    exploitation, and merciless took advantage of it. They were able to do so only because an
                    international system of rules and commitments to self-determination did not yet exist.
                    But we have witnessed the evolution of the normative context through which our behavior and
                    interactions are governed, and what should theoretically follow is a shift toward heightened
                    progressivism. To believe in universal human rights is not to simply identify and correct the
                    relationships between governments and people, but the deeply embedded foundations of economic
                    systems that rely on imbalances in power and wealth. Oppression is not exacted solely by
                    institutions with formal powers, but by establishments that have amassed the necessary wealth and
                    influence to create a system in which they thrive at the expense of those who have less influential
                    capacity. If we have truly progressed toward increased modernity, why has this system continued to
                    persist?
                    The inconsistency lies in what Veblen identified as the war-like nature of our economic system,
                    which provides an odd justification for the continuation of capitalism. An economic order which
                    draws on dog eat dog primitivity doesn’t reflect the level of modernism we have supposedly adopted.
                    We have the framework and a whole host of evidentiary support for the success and merit of
                    alternative economic arrangements. We have made miraculous advances in technology, human rights, and
                    quality of life, yet we remain mired in what some might term backwards traditions. These traditions
                    “have been erected into canons of life,” and while they represent the antithesis to a progressive
                    equality, they also represent a “situation to which men have to adapt themselves,” and a situation
                    which we find normal (Veblen).
                    Where mainstream economics finds that toxic competition is the natural order of human organization,
                    given our supposed proclivity to pride the success of ourselves over the well-being of others,
                    heterodox economics sheds light on the complexity of human development, and how our evolution and
                    reproduction of certain traits within a constantly changing environment can explain certain economic
                    developments. Given the complexity in the inception of this system, the solution is not
                    uncomplicated, or rather, it is not simply defined by government intervention. The government
                    already intervenes in the economy, but strong incentives for corruption and greed mean that this
                    intervention often only serves a small elite class of the population. A functionalist perspective on
                    the state defines it as the “repressive arm of the owning class” which serves the needs of the state
                    by exacting its oppression through “police and military action” (Kaufman).
                    In addition to the upper hand government support gives the capitalist class, there is also the
                    element of consistent class reproduction. Mainstream economics points to hard-work and small element
                    of luck as the ingredients for economic success in this system. However, given the institutional
                    barriers to class mobility, working hard to amass extreme amounts of wealth, the definition of
                    economic success, is hardly the most important indicator of economic success. Sure, the child of a
                    wealthy family might have to work somewhat hard to resist downward mobility—a more common fate that
                    upward mobility—but the fact that they are likely already endowed with the necessary characteristics
                    of a member of the capitalist class means that a boundless network and limitless opportunities have
                    been, and will continue to be available to them. However, even though luck is a recognized element
                    of a capitalist system, and we should find it able to “rule out the conclusions about the relative
                    moral worth of those who success compared with those who fail,” the dream of ‘making it’ in this
                    country prevents this realization (Zweig). Moreover, where mainstream economic theory relies on the
                    supposed ineptitudes of certain classes and races to explain their lack of success in this system,
                    heterodox economics understands that class and wealth inequality are functions of historical and
                    political implications that have erected barriers to adequate living standards. And more,
                    implications which have created the conditions for superfluous wealth for those who believe they’re
                    entitled to it.
                    Although we recognize our country as a melting pot, in which the success of interracial cooperation
                    and harmony should be demonstrated, the country is instead a “fundamentally white nation [which]
                    belongs to its white citizens” (Kaufman). A series of historical events as well as the persistence
                    of explicit and implicit biases that define institutional racism make clear that the reason for
                    racial economic inequality has nothing to do with distressing theories of biological racial
                    hierarchies. Heterodox economics instead identifies biases inherent in media coverage as well as the
                    persistence of ideas of racial inferiority as the root of unequal distribution of wealth and
                    resources between races. If government influences might take a more direct and meaningful role in
                    correcting for these imbalances, versus letting them continue relatively unperturbed, racial
                    inequality would likely cease to be one of the unfortunately prevalent characteristics in our
                    country. Targeting institutions, like banks and insurance companies, for covert racism would allow
                    for greater access to resources among minority communities, and eventually, the realization of a
                    more secure economic future.
